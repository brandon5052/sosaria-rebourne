Changes
Added follower and leader spawns to combat group spawning.
Starting positions for monsters in combat are now randomly selected.
Factored out command substitution from non-init code. Image and combat map compilation times drastically decreased.
Added AC / DMG display to item type strings.
Added optional coloration of items based on a comparison of item parameter to a numeric value, used for showing if equipment is better or worse than current in inventory UI.
During a player turn the player's name is highlighted on the roster.
Refactored config variables and UI for a max party of six. This is really just a personal preference thing. I played U4 and U5, and decided I liked six-member parties better than eight.
Rearranged player status ui.
