Changes
Implemented location-based targeting and converted item system to support it.
Changed calibrated sleep call implementation of jiffy_sleep to a calibrated busy wait. The former was annoyingly inaccurate under cygwin.
Revamped animation system to be capable of multiple simultanious animations.
Implemented Flaming Oil Keg item.
Implemented Healing animation with animation_proc_bg_sweep.
Removed 3D dungeons from the development roadmap. It's just gimicky, plus it's my least favorite type of dungeon crawler.
Added max HP and MP increases to level-up handler.
